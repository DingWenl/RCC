## Training CNN-Former model with RCC for the benchmark dataset
1. Download the code.
2. Download the [benchmark dataset](http://bci.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/download.html) and its [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7740878).
3. Create a model folder to save the model.
4. Change the data and model folder paths in train and test files to your data and model folder paths.

## Subject-independent test in the pretraining directory 
1. Run the '' file to get the pre-trained model


## Subject-adaptive test
